<p>For a long time in history, the society of different countries has been sexist in many aspects. Even the inclusion of women in the Olympics, this global sports event, is affected.</p>
<p>When the first modern Olympics was held in 1896 in Athens, Greece, women were deliberately barred. At the time, the founder of the IOC, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, argued an Olympics with women would be “impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic and indecent.” The Games, he said, were created for “the solemn and periodic exaltation of male athleticism” with “female applause as a reward.”</p>
<p>Under pressure from athletes such as French rower Alice Milliat who even launched a separate Olympics for women, the IOC began including more female events. In 2012, the global sporting body allowed women to compete in all sports on the Olympic program, and it was only in 2014 that it was committed to gender parity at the Games.</p>
<p>As the world is still developing, more and more people began to pay attention to this issue, and the women’s status began to rise, which can be shown in the history of the Olympics. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/8/sexism-is-still-a-problem-at-the-first-gender-equal-olympics">sexism problem in Olympics</a></p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In this Analysis, we draw an animated line graph to show the total number of Male and Female Participants in different seasons of the Olympic Games over the years.</p>
<p>We can see that as time passed, at first, there were almost no female participants in the Olympics till the 1920s, and nearly all participants were male.</p>
<p>After the 1920s, the participation of females slightly increased. Moreover, after the 1950s, the number of female participants started snowballing.</p>

<p>We first try to consider using PCA to analyze how age, height and weight contribute to the result of winning medals.</p>
<p>According to <code>prcomp</code>, we gain the first two principal components contructed as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>PC1 = -0.21 x Age + -0.69 x Height + -0.7 x Weight</p></li>
<li><p>PC2 = 0.98 x Age + -0.19 x Height + -0.11 x Weight</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With rotation metrix be:</p>
<pre><code>##           PC1    PC2    PC3
## Age    -0.212  0.975 -0.059
## Height -0.687 -0.192 -0.701
## Weight -0.695 -0.108  0.710</code></pre>
<p>and importance of the components:</p>
<pre><code>## Importance of components:
##                           PC1    PC2     PC3
## Standard deviation     1.3572 0.9816 0.44211
## Proportion of Variance 0.6138 0.3211 0.06513
## Cumulative Proportion  0.6138 0.9349 1.00000</code></pre>
<p>Draw a score plot with groups colored by <code>medal.</code> Medal results seem not ideal to be classified by principal components composed of Age, Weight, and Height, concerning the fact that the first two principals have already been efficient in explaining 93.5% of the information of Age, Weight, and Height. Yet, the Medal results are still mixed in the score plot.</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-53-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In scatterplot of scaled data points and principal components representative lines, we still couldn’t see different age, weight, and height patterns related to medal results.</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>But for PCA, we can classify athletes into several clusters to represent their features of age, weight and height:</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><strong>Concerning the unideal result drawn by PCA, we use a direct method to describe the three factors</strong>:
### Picture 9</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As the Boxplot of Age suggests, their average age is not significantly related to the type of medal they won for female athletes who won medals. But the average age of female athletes who did not win a medal is lower than that of women who won a medal. For male athletes who won medals, the average age of men who won a silver medal is higher than that of men who won the other two types of medals. The average age of male athletes who did not win a medal is not significantly different from that of men who won gold and bronze medals. Overall, the average height of the athletes is not mainly related to their race results.</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As Boxplot2 of Height indicates, there is no significant difference in average height among the different groups with different types of medals for both male and female athletes. Still, the average height of non-medal athletes is lower than that of medal-winning athletes. In general, the average height of athletes who won medals is higher than the average height of athletes who did not win medals, so it can be considered that height has a specific relationship with race results.</p>
<p><img src="Olympics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As Boxplot3 of Weight reveals, the relationship between athletes’ weight and race results is similar to the relationship between the height and race results of athletes. So we can conclude that weight has a specific relationship with race results since the average weight of athletes who won medals is higher than the average weight of athletes who did not win medals.</p>
