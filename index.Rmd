# Introduction

The Olympics are the leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes around the world participate in a variety of competitions. It is considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. Its origin can be traced back to the Greek empire, at around 3,000 years ago, which consisted only of sprint races, and was held in Greek city Olympia only accessible to freeborn Greek people (Young & Abraham, 2020). It has grown since then and become a hub for all the athletes worldwide to demonstrate their abilities in more than 28 individual sporting contests.

Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame.
